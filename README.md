# Problem Statement:

With FIFA is in the blood of many people of the world. You are tasked to tell the story of unsung
analysts who put great efforts to provide accurate data to answer every question of fans. The
FIFA World Cup is a global football competition contested by the various football-playing
nations of the world. It is contested every four years and is the most prestigious and important
trophy in the sport of football.

The World Cups dataset shows all information about all the World Cups in history, while the
World Cup Matches dataset shows all the results from the matches contested as part of the
cups. Find key metrics and factors that influence the World Cup win. Do your own research
and come up with your findings.
